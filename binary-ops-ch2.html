    <h1>Boolean (Logic) Operators</h1>

    <p>A binary operator is an operator that operates on two operands and manipulates them to return a result.
      
    </p>
    <h2>Basic Operators</h2>
    <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra>The basic operations of Boolean algebra are:</a>
    <ul>
      <li>And (conjunction), <em>denoted x && y</em>
      </li>
      <li>Or (disjunction), <em>denoted x||y </em></li>
      <li>Not (negation),<em>denoted !x</em></li>
    
    </ul>
    <h2>Truth Table</h2>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>x</th>
        <th>y</th>
        <th>!x</th>
        <th>x && y</th>
        <th>x || y</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Derived operators</h2>

    <p>The three Boolean operations described above are referred to as basic, meaning that they can be taken as a basis for other Boolean operations that can be built up from them by composition.</p>
    
    <p>Operations composed from the basic operations include the following example:</p>
    XOR (eXclusive OR), <em>denoted x &oplus; y</em>
